Welcome to 12 Languages! This repository contains a whole bunch of resources, workshops, articles and learning materials relating to 12 different programming languages.  

Loosely based on the idea of [The Pragmatic Programmer's "7 languages in 7 weeks"](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks); this repository is intended to be delved into over the period of a year (one language every month) but obviously the pace is entirely up to you!

SO - Without any ado _whatsoever_:
