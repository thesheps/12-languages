# 12 Languages

> "An irreverent journey through 12 programming languages."

Welcome to 12 Languages! This repository contains a whole bunch of resources, workshops, articles and learning materials relating to 12 different programming languages.  

Loosely based on the idea of [The Pragmatic Programmer's "7 languages in 7 weeks"](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks); this repository is intended to be delved into over the period of a year (one language for every month) but obviously the pace is entirely up to you!

I'll be adding to this repository loads of different coding exercises, katas and koans, and would love some feedback and/or collaboration if anyone has the time!
