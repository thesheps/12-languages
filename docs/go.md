# Month 2 - Go
Go[lang] is a lightweight, compiled and statically-typed programming language created by some crazy folks over at Google. It was designed back in 2007 with the aim of improving programmer productivity. It has been widely adopted for DevOps type purposes, and made massively popular by the Hashicorp corporation for a lot of their products ([Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) amongst others.)
